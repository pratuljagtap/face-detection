## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
```

### 2. Run & Meet Your First Face!
```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

### 3. Watch the Magic Happen
- **New person?** → Press `n` → Type their name → Done!  
- **Old friend?** → Watch their name appear in green!  
- **Analyze photos?** → Choose image mode → Get instant labels!

## 🎮 How It Works

| Step | Action | Visual Feedback |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **1** | System sees a face | 🔴 Red box + "New Person" |
| **2** | You press `n` | Console asks: "Enter name:" |
| **3** | You type "Alex" | 💾 Saves face + name locally |
| **4** | Alex returns later | 🟢 Green box + "Alex" |

**Behind the scenes**:  
Uses battle-tested [LBPH algorithm](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d25/classcv_1_1face_1_1LBPHFaceRecognizer.html) + Haar Cascades — lightweight but powerful!

## 📂 Smart Data Storage

All your face data lives safely in:
```
face_data/
├── faces_data.pkl    # Your face "memory"
├── names.pkl         # Name dictionary
└── known_faces/      # Backup face images (for humans!)
```

> 🔒 **Privacy Guarantee**: Delete this folder to wipe all data instantly. No traces left!

## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results

1. **Lighting is key**: Face a window or lamp (no backlight!)
2. **Multiple angles**: Register the same person 2-3 times while slightly moving
3. **Distance**: Stay 2-5 feet from camera
4. **Glasses/hats**: Remove for best accuracy (or register with them on!)
5. **Group photos**: Works great for labeling family albums!

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| ❌ "Camera not found" | Try `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` in code (for external cams) |
| ❌ "No faces detected" | Get closer to camera; improve lighting |
| ❌ Poor recognition | Register 3+ samples per person |
| ❌ Module errors | Run `pip install opencv-contrib-python` (critical!) |
| ❌ Image mode fails | Use full paths: `C:/photos/me.jpg` (Windows) or `/home/user/photo.jpg` (Linux/Mac) |
